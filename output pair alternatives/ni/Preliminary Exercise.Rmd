**Introduction**

As part of this research project, we've used a statistical model to predict borders that are likely to be distinct boundaries between communities. The statistical model uses census information on the proportion of non-UK born residents in different areas to make its predictions. We want your help to improve the statistical model.

If it's okay, can we start with a short preliminary exercise to get you used to the interactive maps that we will be using? Please take your time.

``` {r make-map-quietly, echo = FALSE}

tm_shape(
  points_sf,
  name = 'Points',
  bbox =tmaptools::bb(bBox)
  ) +
  tm_borders(
#    size = 0.05, # default = 0.02
    lwd = 10,
    col = 'purple') +
  tm_facets('map', sync = T) 


```

**Instructions**: Look at the purple point in each map. Which map contains the point closest to Derry train station?

**Hints**:

- Use the button pictured to open the OpenStreetMap layer to enable you to view locations.

- Use the plus button in the top left hand corner to zoom in and the minus button to zoom out.

- Click and drag on the map to move the viewer.
