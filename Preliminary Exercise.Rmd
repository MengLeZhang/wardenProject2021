```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
library(sf)

sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)

tmap_mode('view')
```

```{r load-data-quietly, echo=FALSE}
#Get map data for comparisons

shefBorders_Here <-

shef_borders <-
  shefBorders_Here %>% readRDS

ukgrid = "+init=epsg:27700"

Rotherham_Centre <- c(442235, 392938)

centrePoint <-
  st_point(
    Rotherham_Centre
  )

centrePoint <-
  centrePoint %>%
  st_sfc(
    crs = st_crs(ukgrid)
  )

```

This initial exercise is in place to help you to familiarise yourself with using interactive maps ahead of the main exercise.

``` {r make-map-quietly, echo = FALSE}

centrePoint %>% qtm

```
