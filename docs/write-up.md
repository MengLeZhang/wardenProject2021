# Testing the presence of social frontiers using participant's perceptions

# Introduction


# Study design

In each area city, the qualitative team was given a map of social frontier produced earlier in the research project. The team chose one areas within each city that had an above average number of social frontiers and thus a higher level of segregation than the rest of the city.

The qualitative interview recruited participants and experts who know the area well. In order, to

For borders in the target area, we calculated a measure of sharpness based on the absolute difference in the proportion of foreign born in LSOAs on side of the border (the actual measure is more complicated, see Dean et al 20xx). We then standardise this measure and denote it as $\Phi$ where large values denote sharper boundaries. In Dean et al's original paper, any border with a value of $\Phi > 1.96$ was considered substantial and likely to be a social frontier (see misc. section).

However, Dean et al algorithm, as well as other algorithms for boundary detection (sharp or otherwise), has not been validated against external


# Experimental design

All borders in a given are placed into quartiles; where quartile 1 $Q1$ are sharpest and $Q4$ the least sharp borders. Each map in a pair consists of borders from 2 quartile groups. For example, map $Q1 + 3$ shows all borders in quartile 1 and 3.

We test the following pairs of maps against each other:
- $Q1 + 2$ versus $Q3 + 4$ (pair 1)
- $Q1 + 2$ versus $Q2 + 3$ (pair 2)
- $Q2 + 4$ versus $Q3 + 4$ (pair 3)
- $Q1 + 3$ versus $Q2 + 4$ (pair 4)


# Rational

Our hypothesis is that participants prefer maps in $Q1 > Q2 > Q3 > Q4$. However,
we would need 6 comparisons to test all possible combinations of $Q1 v Q2$, $Q1 v Q3$ etc.
